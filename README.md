## Project Overview
This C++ implementation provides a complete visual walkthrough of the 0/1 Knapsack solution, from input collection to final DP table computation.

## Why 0/1 Knapsack ?
The 0/1 Knapsack problem is fundamental in computer science because:

ðŸ”¹ Algorithmic Importance
* Classic example for dynamic programming
* Demonstrates optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems
* Benchmark for comparing greedy vs DP approaches

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Applications
* Resource allocation in cloud computing
* Portfolio optimization in finance
* Cryptographic systems design
* Inventory management systems

 ðŸ”¹ Educational Value
*Teaches problem decomposition
*Illustrates time-space tradeoffs
*Introduces pseudo-polynomial time complexity


## Key Features
* Complete Process Visualization - From input to final solution
* Step-by-Step Execution - See each DP table update
* Decision Tracking - Understand each include/exclude choice
* Educational Focus - Designed for algorithm learning
* Interactive Input - User-friendly console interface
